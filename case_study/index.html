          <p class="par3"> This project's object was to make use of Airtableâ€™s API to design and build a website to contain and display my partner's content. I recievied my partner: Elain Fei's airtable containing a collection of 100 chick paintings. It was initially sorted with the painting's description, image, difficulty, technique, and her ability to paint them. From this, I simplified it down to only the images and difficulty and further sorted the 100 paintings into 3 levels of difficulties. I wanted to depict Elaine's painting journey and when she first started painting chicks, which made me create a simple painting game for people who wish to learn how to draw chicks! </p>
